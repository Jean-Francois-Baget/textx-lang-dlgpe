**textx-lang-dlgpe** is a python implementation of parsers and utilities for different languages of the [DLGP family](./docs/family.md), relying upon the meta-language [textX](https://github.com/textX/textX). It does not provide any reasoning service, for which the java library [Integraal](https://gitlab.inria.fr/rules/integraal) is required. It provides, however, a textx implementation for different languages of the DLGP family, that can be considered as their formal specification, parsers for these different languages, as well as some utilities, amongst them translators.

The `textxdlgpe` package provides parsers (basically  *textX* *metamodels*), able to build a *textx* *model* from a string or a file.
This model can be visualized, for educational purpose, [TO FINISH]


**textx-lang-dlgpe** has been created by Jean-Fran√ßois Baget at the [Boreal](https://team.inria.fr/boreal/) team ([Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) and [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/)). It is part of the [Integraal](https://gitlab.inria.fr/rules/integraal) project.
